## Instructions

The application should meet the following criteria:
1. Users can enter **R**, **P**, or **S** to signify their choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
2. The computer's choice is randomly generated for a fair game.
3. Users will be prompted if they enter an invalid choice.
4. After each round, users have the option to play again.
5. At the end of the game, users can view their total wins, losses, ties, and how many times they chose each option.

## Key Features

* **Replay Option:** Allows users to play multiple rounds.
* **Player Input:** Users can input their choice via `prompt()`.
* **Game Tracking:** Tracks total wins, ties, and losses for the player.
* **Random Computer Choice:** The computer generates a random choice using JavaScript's `Math.random`.
* **Detailed Statistics:** Displays the count of each user choice (e.g., how many times they chose rock, paper, or scissors).

## Technology Stack

This project uses the following technologies:
* **JavaScript:** Powers the game logic, random choice generation, and user interaction.
* **Browser Alerts and Prompts:** Utilizes `alert()`, `prompt()`, and `confirm()` for user interaction.
